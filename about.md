<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>
I am <strong>Zahra Kanani</strong>, a Biomedical Engineer specializing in <strong>Artificial Intelligence for Healthcare</strong> and <strong>Medical Device Regulation</strong>. 
My interdisciplinary background bridges <em>machine learning, medical imaging, and regulatory science</em>, aiming to make AI tools both scientifically robust and clinically trustworthy.
</p>

<p>
Currently, I am completing my <strong>Master 2 in Artificial Intelligence for One Health</strong> at <strong>Université Grenoble Alpes</strong>, where my research at the <strong>Laboratoire d’Informatique de Grenoble (LIG)</strong> focuses on improving semi-supervised learning under class imbalance. 
I have developed and trained deep learning models in <strong>PyTorch</strong>, proposing a hybrid <em>AdaMatch–FlexMatch</em> method that enhances fairness and generalization in medical data.
</p>

<p>
Previously, as a <strong>Regulatory Specialist</strong> at the <strong>Food and Drug Administration of Iran</strong>, I evaluated orthopedic and cardiovascular medical devices for compliance with <em>ISO 13485</em> and <em>EU MDR</em> standards. 
This experience reinforced my commitment to advancing AI in medicine with safety, transparency, and ethical responsibility.
</p>

<p>
My current goal is to contribute to <strong>trustworthy, clinically validated AI systems</strong> that integrate seamlessly into healthcare practice — combining my technical expertise in deep learning with regulatory insight and a strong interest in medical innovation.
