<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>
I am <strong>Zahra Kanani</strong>, a <strong>Biomedical Engineer</strong> specializing in <strong>Artificial Intelligence for Healthcare</strong> and <strong>Medical Device Regulation</strong>. 
My interdisciplinary background bridges <em>machine learning, biomedical data analysis, and regulatory science</em>, with a focus on developing AI tools that are both scientifically robust and clinically trustworthy.
</p>

<p>
I hold a <strong>Master 2 in Artificial Intelligence for One Health</strong> from <strong>Université Grenoble Alpes</strong>, where my research at the <strong>Laboratoire d’Informatique de Grenoble (LIG)</strong> explores semi-supervised learning under class imbalance. 
Working with <strong>PyTorch</strong>, I have developed deep learning models and proposed a hybrid <em>AdaMatch–FlexMatch</em> approach that improves fairness and generalization across medical datasets.
</p>

<p>
Before this, I earned my <strong>Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in Biomedical Engineering</strong>, which laid the foundation for my strong analytical and interdisciplinary approach to healthcare innovation. 
As a <strong>Regulatory Specialist</strong>, I evaluated medical devices for compliance with <em>ISO 13485</em> and <em>EU MDR</em> standards — an experience that deepened my commitment to safe, transparent, and ethically responsible AI in medicine.
</p>

<p>
My goal is to contribute to the development of <strong>trustworthy, clinically validated AI systems</strong> that seamlessly integrate into healthcare practice — combining my technical expertise in deep learning with biomedical insight and regulatory understanding.
