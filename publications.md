<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>
This study investigates how suturing parameters affect leakage in intestinal anastomosis using finite element analysis.
The model analyzed variations in stitch spacing, bite depth, and tissue thickness to evaluate their influence on leakage pressure.
Results showed that decreasing stitch spacing and increasing bite depth significantly improved sealing performance.
These findings provide biomechanical insights for optimizing surgical techniques and reducing postoperative complications.
