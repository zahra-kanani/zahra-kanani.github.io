**Abstract (full content):**  
The study investigates how suturing parameters affect leakage in intestinal anastomosis using finite element analysis. The simulation model considered variations in stitch spacing, bite depth, and tissue thickness to determine their influence on leakage pressure. Results showed that decreasing stitch spacing and increasing bite depth significantly improved sealing performance. These findings provide biomechanical insight for optimizing surgical techniques and reducing postoperative complications.
